<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<br>
<p>For the first animal with the lion head and body, a big bird’s wings and a snake tail, I wanted to make an animal that can conquer a lot of power. Lions are superior and with big wings to fly and a poisonous snake tail, I thought it was cool. For my second animal with the pig’s head and body, elephant ears and butterfly wings, I wanted to make a cute animal. To make these hybrids, I would cut them out from their original pictures then try to scale and place them where I want them to go. Then I would use the blur tool to make the combined animal parts look like they are actually attracted to each other. After creating the two animals, I would then place them on to a new background.
