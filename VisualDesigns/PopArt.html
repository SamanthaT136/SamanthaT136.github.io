	<p>I picked the pop art gradient I created of Selena Gomez. I chose this artwork instead of the other two pop arts because I loved the final product of it. The reason I picked Selena Gomez was because I am such a fan of her. I love her music, enjoyed her whole filmography and am obsessed with her Rare Beauty makeup line. I wanted to apply pastel colors to the background so that Selena can pop in the foreground. The process of creating this was by downloading a photo of Selena and opening up her picture to Adobe Photoshop. I then use the selection tool to clear the background of the original picture to just have Selena. I added an ombre effect using pink and blue which can be shown on the first top left pic. Then I copy and pasted that photo three times to change the colors from the first picture and placed them in fours.
