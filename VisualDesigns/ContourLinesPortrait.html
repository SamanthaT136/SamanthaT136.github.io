<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<br>
<p>I used a photo that I took on snapchat and decided to outline it. I added a bolded text with my name. I changed the color to maroon and edited the text to make it look groovy. I also placed the text on the foreground because I forgot how to place it in the background. I used the pen tool to outline the image, then used the text box tool to create the text with my name and added a pink background color to it.</p>
