<br>
<p>My original shape was a regular flower before it was turned into a mandala. I chose a flower because I thought it would come out very pretty. I knew I wanted to make the flowers purple, teal, blue and red. So after each layer, I would change the previous color, and use the scale tool to decrease the size. Then I would use the rotate tool to turn the layer around fifteen degrees each time, so it would give off the effect that a mandala is supposed to give.</p> </center>
