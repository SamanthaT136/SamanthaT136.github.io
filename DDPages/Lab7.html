<br>
 At the end of the movie, Mr. Grinch learns about the values of christmas and how much joy can be brought upon from that one day. Stan Mr. Grinch!

Moral of the story: <b> looks matter especially when you're far too displeasing to even look human (like the grinch)</b> even though he's the best character out here yupp rocking that sweater. get up in there under that misletoeee. 
<br>
<strong> We stan Mr. Grinch.  I said what I said 😜 Santa too I guess, I mean they both woke up Christmas morning and choose swag, yuppp with those cookie munchies and gifts and great fashion sense that really make their eyes POP. Amazing day! :)</strong>

<div style= "background-color:LavenderBlush";<
<h2 style= "color:red";< Cindy Lou </h2>
<img src="../Cindy_Lou.jpg" alt= "Cindy Lou" height = "250" width = "200">
<p style= "color:red";>  Cindy Lou is a character created by none other than Dr. Seuss himself. She is one of the main characters in the film <em> How the Grinch Stole Christmas </em> as well as other films. She is a character who is viewed as a sweet ittle girl and is one of the few people who was not afraid of the Grinch. Throughout the story, Cindy rather tried to <em> understand </em> the grinch. She is definitely out of the ordinary as you can see, she needs a brush for her hair. It looks like she used 7 bottles of <em> <strong> hairspray. </strong> </em> Extraordinary goes with extraordinary I guess. She is seen as the sweet little girl that brought eveyone together, but we all know she was just in it for the money and power over Whoville💰💅🏼, its why she hasn't gotten her nose. BUT overall she taught everyone the spirit of real Christmas so that put her on the nice list I guess </p>
