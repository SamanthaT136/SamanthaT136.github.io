<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<br>
<p>My original image was a turkey on a table since this part of the assignment was to upload a picture of our favorite Thanksgiving foods. For the filter transformation, I wanted to add a layer of a rough texture which helped make the image look different from the original. On top of that, I changed the overall image to pink, which looked appealing to me. The process of taking the new image I created into a kaleidoscope was not challenging. Just copying and pasting the new image to all open spaces and adjusting it so the final outcome can look neat and precise.
