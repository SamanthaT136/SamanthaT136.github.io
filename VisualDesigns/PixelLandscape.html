<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<br>
<p>My audience is anyone who is looking at my recreation. There is no specific demographic that I want to view this. It is more of a piece for everyone. I created the different aspects of my landscape by simply focusing on the layering of the different parts of the landscape. Outlining and mostly filling it in with the brush tool. I chose this specific landscape to recreate because I just couldnâ€™t pick anything else. Something about the landscape drew me to it. The overall energy of the landscape made me choose it. As I was working, I was thinking about how much work it must take to recreate the landscape. That there are so many parts to remake that displays a beautiful bigger picture.
