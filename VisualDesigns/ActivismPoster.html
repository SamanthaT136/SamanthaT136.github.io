<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<br>
<p>For this artwork, I created a poster based on the global issue I made a presentation on. The global issue that the poster is displaying is fast fashion. I didn’t want to add a lot of effects because then it would confuse the audience with a wrong message. I used a black background that has details on clothing fabric. I then found a graphic on canva of a hijab woman. After that, I wrote the words “No one should die for fashion” because that’s the message I want the poster to convey.
