    <p class="p2">  Hi, my name is Samantha Torres, and i'm a student at Bronx Early College Academy (<strong><a href = "https://beca324.org/"> BECA  </a> </strong>). I am in 11th grade. And this my third year at this school. I just turned 16 on September 16, so this is like my golden year. </p>

    <h2> Interests</h2>

    <p class="p2"> I love going on car rides (<em>especially to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan"> Manhattan</a></em>). As much as I love going outside, I also enjoy staying inside. I like watching movies and tv shows on <a href = "https://www.netflix.com/"> netflix </a> in my free time. I recently got in to korean shows and I like it a lot. I hope to be a psychologist in the future and that is something I want to achieve. And lastly, I love playing with my dog, she's a chihuahua.</p>
